@Requirement [id=rq1] [description = Return a list where each element is a word from fname.]
Rationale  [id=ra1] [description = based on strip() and split() functions]
TestCase   [id=tc1] [description= If in the fname, there is a word ¡®example¡¯, then a list of [e,x,a,m,p,l,e] will be returned]
Priority     [High]

@Requirement [id=rq2]  [description = Return a dictionary given list lst.  Each key is an element in the lst. The value is always 1.]
 Rationale  [id=ra2] [description=For a dictionary, the d[w] means the value of the key w in the dictionary.]
 TestCase   [id=tc2] [description= When the list is [1,3,5,7], then the 1st,3th,5th,7th content of the dictionary will be changed to the value 1]
 Priority     [Medium]

@Requirement [id=rq3] [description = Return a dictionary where each key is a word both in the file fname and in the dictionary english_dictionary, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that word.]
 Rationale  [id=ra3] [description=Convert all uppercase characters in a string to lowercase]
 TestCase   [id=tc3] [description = firstly select a word which is in the file name( for example "the"), and then make the word "the" into lowercase,  if there does not exist in the english dictionary it return 1, otherwise return its frequency of that word and plus 1]
 Priority     [Medium]

@Requirement [id=rq4] [description = Return a sorted list of tuples, each tuple containing a key and a value. Note that the tuples are order in descending order of the value.]
 Rationale  [id=ra4] [description=Sort lists according to the specified key.]
 TestCase   [id=tc4] [description = When the input is {¡®t¡¯:2,¡¯h¡¯:4,¡¯e¡¯:1}, then the return result will be  ((¡®h¡¯,4),(¡¯t¡¯,2),(¡¯e¡¯,1)]
 Priority     [Low]

@Requirement [id=rq5] [description = We get the whole word appeared in the words.txt in lowercase, and then get the frequency of the word not only in the brexit-news.txt but also firstly exists in the dictionary words.txt. ]
 Rationale  [id=ra5] [description=Under if__name_='main': the code will only be executed in the case (that is, the file is executed directly as a script), and if it is import to other scripts, will not be executed.]
 TestCase   [id=tc5] [description = When the words.txt has words [a,B,c,d,f,k,W],then the ed is{¡®a¡¯:1, ¡®b¡¯:1, ¡®c¡¯:1, ¡®d¡¯:1, ¡®f¡¯:1, ¡®k¡¯:1, ¡®w¡¯:1}. If the content of brexit-news.txt is ¡®This is only a test case.fwkaabcwk¡¯, then the output will be ((¡®a¡¯,4),(¡®c¡¯2,),(¡®w¡¯,2),(¡®k¡¯,2),(¡®f¡¯,1),(¡®b¡¯,1),(¡®d¡¯,0)) ]
